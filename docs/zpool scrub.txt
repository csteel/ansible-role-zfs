       zpool scrub [-s] pool ...

           Begins a scrub. The scrub examines all data in the specified pools to verify that it checksums correctly. For replicated (mirror
           or  raidz)  devices,  ZFS  automatically  repairs any damage discovered during the scrub. The "zpool status" command reports the
           progress of the scrub and summarizes the results of the scrub upon completion.

           Scrubbing and resilvering are very similar operations. The difference is that resilvering only examines data that ZFS  knows  to
           be  out  of date (for example, when attaching a new device to a mirror or replacing an existing device), whereas scrubbing exam-
           ines all data to discover silent errors due to hardware faults or disk failure.

           Because scrubbing and resilvering are I/O-intensive operations, ZFS only allows one  at  a  time.  If  a  scrub  is  already  in
           progress,  the  "zpool  scrub"  command terminates it and starts a new scrub. If a resilver is in progress, ZFS does not allow a
           scrub to be started until the resilver completes.

           -s    Stop scrubbing.
