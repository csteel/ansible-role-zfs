       zpool replace [-f] [-o property=value] pool old_device [new_device]

           Replaces  old_device with new_device. This is equivalent to attaching new_device, waiting for it to resilver, and then detaching
           old_device.

           The size of new_device must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of all the devices in a mirror or raidz configuration.

           new_device is required if the pool is not redundant. If new_device is not specified, it defaults to  old_device.  This  form  of
           replacement  is  useful  after an existing disk has failed and has been physically replaced. In this case, the new disk may have
           the same /dev path as the old device, even though it is actually a different disk. ZFS recognizes this.

           -f    Forces use of new_device, even if its appears to be in use. Not all devices can be overridden in this manner.

           -o property=value
                 Sets the given pool properties. See the "Properties" section for a list of valid properties that  can  be  set.  The  only
                 property  supported  at  the  moment is ashift.  Do note that some properties (among them ashift) are not inherited from a
                 previous vdev. They are vdev specific, not pool specific.
