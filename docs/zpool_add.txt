       zpool add [-fgLnP] [-o property=value] pool vdev ...

           Adds the specified virtual devices to the given pool. The vdev specification is described in the "Virtual Devices"  sec-
           tion. The behavior of the -f option, and the device checks performed are described in the "zpool create" subcommand.

           -f    Forces use of vdevs, even if they appear in use or specify a conflicting replication level. Not all devices can be
                 overridden in this manner.

           -g    Display vdev GUIDs instead of the normal device names. These GUIDs can be used in place of device  names  for  the
                 zpool detach/offline/remove/replace commands.

           -L    Display  real  paths  for vdevs resolving all symbolic links. This can be used to look up the current block device
                 name regardless of the /dev/disk/ path used to open it.

           -n    Displays the configuration that would be used without actually adding the vdevs.  The  actual  pool  creation  can
                 still fail due to insufficient privileges or device sharing.

           -P    Display full paths for vdevs instead of only the last component of the path.  This can be used in conjunction with
                 the -L flag.

           -o property=value

               Sets the given pool properties. See the "Properties" section for a list of valid properties that  can  be  set.  The
               only property supported at the moment is ashift.  Do note that some properties (among them ashift) are not inherited
               from a previous vdev. They are vdev specific, not pool specific.

           Do not add a disk that is currently configured as a quorum device to a zpool. After a disk is in the pool, that disk can
           then be configured as a quorum device.
