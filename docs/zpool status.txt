       zpool status [-gLPvxD] [-T d | u] [pool] ... [interval [count]]

           Displays the detailed health status for the given pools. If no pool is specified, then the status of each pool in the system  is
           displayed. For more information on pool and device health, see the "Device Failure and Recovery" section.

           If  a  scrub  or resilver is in progress, this command reports the percentage done and the estimated time to completion. Both of
           these are only approximate, because the amount of data in the pool and the other workloads on the system can change.

           -g          Display vdev GUIDs instead of the normal device names. These GUIDs can be used innplace  of  device  names  for  the
                       zpool detach/offline/remove/replace commands.

           -L          Display real paths for vdevs resolving all symbolic links. This can be used to look up the current block device name
                       regardless of the /dev/disk/ path used to open it.

           -P          Display full paths for vdevs instead of only the last component of the path.  This can be used in  conjunction  with
                       the -L flag.

           -v          Displays  verbose  data  error  information, printing out a complete list of all data errors since the last complete
                       pool scrub.

           -x          Only display status for pools that are exhibiting errors or are otherwise  unavailable.  Warnings  about  pools  not
                       using the latest on-disk format will not be included.

           -D          Display  a  histogram of deduplication statistics, showing the allocated (physically present on disk) and referenced
                       (logically referenced in the pool) block counts and sizes by reference count.

           -T d | u    Display a time stamp.

                       Specify u for a printed representation of the internal representation of time. See time(2). Specify d  for  standard
                       date format. See date(1).
